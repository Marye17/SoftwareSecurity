# SoftwareSecurity
CS 305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company that creates financial plans for its clients in order to help them manage their debt, savings, and investments. They wanted the ability to securely pass these financial reports to and from their clients via a website. Because of the sensitive information, security was of high importance.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Security is very important to a company's well-being because it ties directly back to clients’ trust in that company. When security breaches happen, clients leave and go to places that feel offer more protection to their data. That's why it’s imperative the code security is up to industry standards.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Having worked in development before, I had heard of a lot of these security concerns and solutions, like certificates, dependency checks, things like that, but I had never seen how they all relate together or what they actually do. This effort really tied a lot of those strings together for me, giving me a better idea of the infrastructure that goes into developing secure code.  

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by adding the ability to utilize HTTPS, adding a hash function, and researching dependency vulnerabilities. I would use the same tools, (Maven, SHA-256, ect) in the future.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I verified the application was functional and secure by running the code and making sure there were no errors. I also reviewed the code manually for any security gaps. After refactoring, I ran the code again to make sure it was still working and then I re-verified the dependency report.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The Maven dependency report tool and resources, the Java Security information, and hash functions.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The ability to code a hash function using a cipher algorithm and the ability to read and understand dependency reports.
